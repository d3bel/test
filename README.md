# My portfolio

This is my portfolio to represent myself as a developer

1.  For back-end I am using Sanity https://www.sanity.io/
2.  I follow the guidelines from a guy at youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HNyXCPDQ7Q&t=237s
3.  I made changes so I can adapt the portfolio to my needs
4.  As the video was over an year old, some of the used technologies were updated a few versions above so I went through the documentation and made changes where were needed.
